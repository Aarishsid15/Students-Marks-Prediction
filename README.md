# Student Marks Prediction:-
I’m happy to share my latest project! I built this tool to help predict a student's final marks based on their academic progress and study habits throughout the semester.

# Project Overview:-
The goal of this project is to use data to understand a student's academic trajectory. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to see the final results, this model analyzes current performance metrics—like assignment averages and midterm scores—to forecast the final grade. It’s a simple way to see how a student is doing and where they might end up.

# The Intuition:-
The idea came from a simple question: "Can we predict the final outcome early enough to make a difference?"

I wanted to build something that looks at the work a student is putting in right now. By analyzing patterns in attendance, quiz scores, and study time, the model can estimate the final score. This helps in understanding which academic behaviors actually correlate with better grades, making it easier to focus on what matters most for success.

# Key Features:-
1. Academic Performance: It looks at Midterm scores, Quiz averages, and Assignment grades.
2. Practical Work: Includes Project scores to see how well a student applies what they've learned.
3. Engagement: Tracks attendance and participation in class.
4. Effort: Looks at the total study hours a student puts in per week.
5. Final Output: Predicts both a numerical Total Score and a letter Grade.

# How I Built It:-
1. Data Processing: Cleaning the data and making sure the categorical info (like departments) was ready for the model.
2. Model Training: I used machine learning to find the relationship between daily academic activities and the final grade.
3. Validation: Testing the model to ensure the predictions are as accurate as possible.
